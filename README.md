ProjectToo is a database backed web application that allows suppliers & manufacturers to privately list equipment - superseeded capital equipment, surplus instruments, near-expired consumable items, etc - and connect those items with the NGO's, NFPs, and Charitable Organisations that need them.

## Technology Used

Created using:
- Ruby
- CSS
- SQL
- Sinatra
- PG
- BCrypt

## Approach Taken

Began by building a flowchart and rough database outline:

From there I began building the program, starting with establishing the user login, create profile, and session framework then progressing on to the various pages and functionality for users to access and utilise the database.
